These sessions are **user-centred** and focus on the *real* issues Mphil researchers face while writing the dissertation — frequent questions, practical problems, and how to diagnose and improve drafts using good (and not-so-good) examples from past work at diverse universities.

## What you’ll actually do

- Work through common stumbling blocks for dissertations (structure, argument, evidence, clarity).  
- **Review excerpts from previous dissertations** together—what works, what doesn’t, and why. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Apply checklists/templates to *your* text so you leave with concrete next steps.
