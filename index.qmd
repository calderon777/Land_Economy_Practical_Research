# DRDS Workshops: Research Methods Diagrams

This mini-site includes translated and adapted diagrams of **Quantitative** and **Qualitative** research processes (inspired by Sampieri, FernÃ¡ndez-Collado, & Baptista Lucio, 8th ed.).

Use the **Diagrams** tab in the navigation bar to see both Mermaid flowcharts.

> Tip: You can copy/paste the Mermaid blocks into slides or other chapters of your Quarto book.
